# Solver

A rebuild version from v1.

I found the windows 7/8 minesweeper no longer runs on my machine because of windows update.

So I "made" a new game for the solver.

I just copy the [minesweeper online](http://minesweeperonline.com/)'s js code and make it into nw package.

So it's a solver for minesweeper.nw ([node webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/)) now.

Or you can download its exe file(for windows) [here](https://mega.nz/#F!5E8CVQJS!j0trk6Zy8GoOk36M3xTbEg)

The Solver is writen by using windows api, so it can only on windows.

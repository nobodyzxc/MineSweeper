# MineSweeperSolver

A new version made from v1 after one year.

Old version of minesweeper no longer supports on my windows 10.

So I "made" a new game for the solver.

I just copy the js code on [minesweeper online](http://minesweeperonline.com/) and make it into nw package.

Thus , it's a solver for minesweeper.nw ([node webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/)) now.

(minesweeper.nw is in parent directory)

Or you can download its exe file(for windows) [here](https://mega.nz/#F!5E8CVQJS!j0trk6Zy8GoOk36M3xTbEg)

The Solver is writen by using windows api, so it can only run on windows.

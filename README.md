# MineSweeperProject
A series of practices about MineSweeper.

It contains two parts.

    1.Make a MineSweeper game.

        Socket ? I want to make a game server that supports multiple play.
        CURSES ?
        GUI    ?

    2.Make a Solver to solve it.

        How to -> DFS ?
                  linear algebra ?

    Most important of all , I want to provide a platform to write solvers and compare them.
